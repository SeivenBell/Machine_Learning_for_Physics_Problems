===PROBLEM STATEMENT===

In this assignment you train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to perform
multiplication of two integers written in their binary representations.

In the folder `data` you will find 3 text files, containing binary
representations of numbers A_i, B_i, and C_i= A_i * B_i for each line i. Each
A_i and B_i have 8 digits, while C_i has 16.

The binary numbers are encoded in the files in “little endian” format, meaning
the least significant digit is on the left. That is, given an integer A, with
binary representation A = ...a_2 a_1 a_0, the line in the input file reads a_0
a_1 a_2 ...

There are only 10 such examples in the included dataset. Select a few of them
and perform the multiplication by hand to understand how it works and why an
RNN is a good model for this task.

Next, you should write a python function which will generate a larger version of
the dataset provided to you. You may assume that the factors have at most 8
digits in their binary representation.

You should take the random seed, training set size, and test set size as
arguments to your script.

When performing the multiplication, you should feed the RNN
such as
Do one hot encodded 

a_0 b_0 a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 ... a_n b_n (16 bits, 8 bits from A and 8 bits from B combined)
Interleaved Format

and get a corresponding output

c_0 c_1 c_2 ... c_2n-1 (16 bits)

in order to keep the input and output sequences the same length.

You should report the training and test losses periodically during training, and
one final time when the training terminates. Given that multiplication is
commutative, also compute and display the loss on both the training and test
sets that you obtain when you swap inputs A and B.

The command to run your code should be of the format in these examples:

--------------------------------
python main.py --param param/param.json --train-size 10000 --test-size 1000 --seed 1234
--------------------------------

And here is an example run of argparse --help:

--------------------------------
usage: main.py [-h] [--param param.json] [--train-size INT] [--test-size INT] [--seed INT]

Trains an RNN to perform multiplication of binary integers A * B = C

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  --param param.json  file containing hyperparameters
  --train-size        size of the generated training set
  --test-size         size of the generated test set
  --seed              random seed used for creating the datasets
--------------------------------

Finally an example json file is provided in ./param folder here with some
suggested attributes. You are allowed to have more or less attributes as long
as you provide a clear documentation. As usual, you should be doing some tuning
of your hyperparameters in order to get good performance from the model.

Note: The last commit to the master branch of your repository before the
deadline is used to assess your work. (Github’s timestamp is a strict deadline
for acceptance of your work). You should also have a documented history of
development in your branch history.
